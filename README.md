# hello-world
Hello world! This is my repository for learning all things code with Code Kentucky.
My name is *Kaitlyn **MacKenzi** Mallory*.
I am *27* years old and live in **Stanton, Kentucky**.
For the past 4 years I have worked as a Sonographer in a hospital setting.
I am learning to *code* to get out of ~~healthcare~~!ðŸ˜‚
I have always been interested in tech and am so excited for this new opportunity.
